 * This demo examines the tracking of multiple touch points. For each touch point, a circle is painted on the display
 * below the finger. The circle follows the user's finger as the finger moves. The colour for each touch point
 * remains consistent, even if earlier touch points terminate. <p>
 *
 * Below is a screen snap showing four contact points (left) and UI photo showing three (right):

 *
 * If fingers always left the tablet in the reverse order from touching, multitouch would be simple. Of course, there is
 * no guarantee that finger events will be so orderly. To manage touch events for multiple fingers, each finger touch
 * point (also called a <i>pointer</i>) has both an <i>index</i> and an <i>identifier</i>. Understanding the distinction
 * between a pointer index and a pointer identifier is the first challenge in working with multitouch. We'll attempt a
 * brief explanation here, but the references above are the primary sources for unravelling the details of multitouch.
 * The blog reference is particularly helpful as it builds up the code bit by bit, with explanations along the way.
 * </p>
 *
 *
 * We noted in Demo_Touch that the primary actions for touch events are </p>
 *
 * <blockquote> <table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6"> <tr bgcolor="#cccccc"> <th>Action <th>Description
 *
 * <tr> <td><code>ACTION_DOWN</code> <td>A finger has touched the display surface
 *
 * <tr> <td><code>ACTION_MOVE</code> <td>The finger has moved
 *
 * <tr> <td><code>ACTION_UP</code> <td>The finger has left the display surface </table> </blockquote> </p>
 *
 * Multitouch is a bit more complicated. The primary actions for multitouch are </p>
 *
 * <blockquote> <table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6"> <tr bgcolor="#cccccc"> <th>Action <th>Description
 *
 * <tr> <td><code>ACTION_DOWN</code> <td>The first finger has touched the display surface
 *
 * <tr> <td><code>ACTION_POINTER_DOWN</code> <td>A subsequent finger has touched the display surface
 *
 * <tr> <td><code>ACTION_MOVE</code> <td>A finger has moved on the display surface
 *
 * <tr> <td><code>ACTION_POINTER_UP</code> <td>A finger (but not the last finger) has left the display surface
 *
 * <tr> <td><code>ACTION_UP</code> <td>The last finger has left the display surface </table> </blockquote> </p>
 *
 * Of course, there is no guarantee that the first finger to touch the display surface will be the last finger to leave
 * the display surface. When a finger, or pointer, first touches the display surface, it is assigned an identifier
 * (<code>id</code>). The <code>id</code> will not change for the duration of the movement associated with that finger.
 * However, the index of the finger/pointer might change from one touch event to the next. This is simply an artefact of
 * the possibility of multiple fingers touching and leaving the display surface, and in any order. </p>
 *
 * As noted in the <code>MotionEvent</code> API, <p>
 *
 * <blockquote> <i>The number of pointers only ever changes by one as individual pointers go up and down.</i>
 * </blockquote>
 *
 * The index of the changed pointer is retrieved from the <code>MotionEvent</code> object ( <code>me</code>) by </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 *      int pointerIndex = me.getActionIndex();
 * </pre>
 *
 * The <code>id</code> is retrieved by<p>
 *
 * <pre>
 *      int pointerId = me.getPointerId(pointerIndex);
 * </pre>
 *
 * In this demo, touch points are managed through two arrays, <code>touchPointId</code> and <code>touchPoints</code>.
 * The goal is to maintain consistency between an <code>id</code>, which corresponds to a particular finger or pointer,
 * and the <i>x/y</i> coordinates associated with that <code>id</code>. Consult the source code for further details.
 * </p>
